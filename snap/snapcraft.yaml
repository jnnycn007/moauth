summary: OAuth 2.0 Authorization and Resource Server
description: |
  mOAuth is a basic OAuth 2.0 client/server implementation designed for testing
  and development of OAuth-based services.  The client library supports
  authorization of native macOS, iOS, and Linux applications with PKCE.  The
  server is both an Authorization Server and a Resource Server that supports:

  - User account authentication/authorization using PAM
  - Traditional web-based authorization grants with redirection as well as
    resource owner password credentials grants
  - Token introspection for services
  - Basic Resource Server functionality with implicit and explicit ACLs
  - Customizable web interface
