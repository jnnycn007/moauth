moauth - A Basic OAuth2 Client/Server Implementation
====================================================

`moauth` is a new project that will implement:

- An OAuth2 authorization server against local user accounts or a separate
  password and group data store.
- A simple OAuth2 client library for applications or services to support OAuth2.
- A PAM module to support authorization and access control using an OAuth2
  server.

My primary goal for this project is development and testing of applications and
services that use or support OAuth2.
